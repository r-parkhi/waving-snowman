### Snowman  
Draw the snowman using the `ellipse(x, y, w, h)`; command.

Start off by making a circle, for the bottom of the snowman, with an `ellipse()`command. Make sure the bottom of your snowman is a circle near the bottom of the canvas and it's not too small!

Now draw a second circle, for the middle of your snowman, using another `ellipse()` command. This should be the second `ellipse()` command in your program.

Make sure that your second circle is a little smaller than the bottom circle, and that it sits on top of the bottom circle.

Add a third circle for the head. 

### Ground
Now we don't want the snowman floating in the air so use the `rect(x, y, w, h)`; command to draw the ground, so that the snowman isn't just floating in air. Check out what happens when the `rect( )` command is before and after the `ellipse()` commands for the snowman. Have the snowman in the front of the ground.

Now you'll make it look like the snowman is waving by adding arms on both sides of his body, using the `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`; command.

Now give the snowman some eyes and a nose. Be creative.

Also add color.
